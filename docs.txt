Steps on how to push an HTML file

1a. create a folder and name it something
    - example: I named my folder "TCSMEANStackTraining"
1b. if you have a folder from GitHub you want to clone, type "git clone [folder]"
    - example: If I have a folder on GitHub, I type "git clone TCSMEANStackTraining"
2. create a folder inside your folder that uses Angular
    - example: My folder inside "TCSMEANStackTraining" is called "Angular_App"
3. create an file inside the main folder
    - example: I created an HTML file called "sample.html"
4. create a documentation file inside the main folder
    - example: "docs.txt"
5. open the terminal, and change directory ("cd") to your main folder.
6. check the files in your folder and see if there is a ".git" and ".gitignore"
if there isn't, make those files by typing in "touch .git" and "touch .gitignore"
7. run some commands in this order
    a. git add .
    b. git status
    c. git commit -m "files added"
    d. git push master HEAD
8. log onto your GitHub
9. take a screenshot of your output, and also your HTML code
10. create a .gitignore text file inside the main folder
    - I don't want the "docs.txt" or any of screenshots to show
11. repeat step #7
